# Algorithm implementations

This repository containts multiple algorithm implementations.

Descriptive analytics:
- VariMax factor rotation

Predictive analytics:
- KNN-Classifier [Python]
- C4.5 (without prunning) [Pyhton
- 

Prescriptive analytics:
Implementations for a **simulated annealing heuritic and genetic heuristic** could not be published because of rules of ownership uncertainties.


The implementations are not optimized for performance and do not offer installation compatability.
They are simply done to provide proof of concept.
