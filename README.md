# Algorithm implementations

This repository containts multiple algorithm implementations.

Predictive analytics:
- KNN-Classifier [Python]
- C4.5 (without prunning) [Pyhton
- 

Implementations for a simulated annealing heuritic, genetic heuristic or iterative breadth first search and could not be published because of rules of ownership uncertainties.

The implementations are not optimized for performance and do not offer installation compatability.
They are simply done to provide proof of concept.
