# Algorithm implementations

This repository contains multiple home-made algorithm implementations.
All algorithms can be categorized as part of business analytics.

**Descriptive analytics:**
- VariMax factor rotation

**Predictive analytics:**
- KNN-Classifier [Python]
- C4.5 like tree learner (without prunning) [Pyhton]

**Prescriptive analytics:**
Implementations for a **simulated annealing heuritic and genetic heuristic** could not be published because of rules of ownership uncertainties.

The implementations are not optimized for performance and do not offer installation compatability.
They are simply done to provide proof of concept.
